In 10 Minutes This Room Will Explode!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv0iVoSZzN8,600.0,en,"I just started this ten minute timer and
when it hit zero that room all the way over there,
full of money will explode. And the only man that can stop it
is this man in this straight jacket. This video is completely real time. You'll notice it's exactly 10 minutes long. There are no cuts.
You see everything. And if Darcy does not escape
his jacket and get through all five floors of
this tower and press that button before the timer hits
zero, his money explodes. All right, he's coming down. Okay,
this is our first ever real-time shoot. - I got to go quick.
- Get in here, let's go. Go, go. 
Hey, hurry, unhatch this. Wait, how did he get out of that jacket 
so fast? It doesn't matter. This next
floor is twice as hard to escape. Slower, slower, slower. Holy. You put fire in there? Okay,
so to get out of that metal cage, you need to use the lock pick 
on the floor, hurry up. - Faster! 
- Darcy! Come on. Come on. Oh my gosh, come on. Even with a tool,
picking a lock takes some fidgeting. He has to perfectly align all three pins
inside the lock in order to break free. By the way, in order to prove this video 
is 100% real-time. starting now, you're going to see 
an unbroken shot of Darcy in the corner of the full video. And as of now, a minute has gone by
and he's still in the first room. And remember, he still needs to get through all five floors of this tower
and press the button in time... The button's right here. ...to keep his quarter
of a million dollars from exploding. I'm getting so much anxiety. Please go faster Wait, Mack, he's picking the lock. Is he making good time or not? So now, yeah, But he's about to go down
to an even more difficult room. Be careful. Don't catch a fire. Darcy, go. - Go! Go!
- Come on, what are you doing, bro? go. He's coming down the rope, he's in the glue room now. Welcome to floor number four. Come on. He's already made it 
to floor four. This is floor number four. - Ok.
- What is it? So this entire floor
is now covered in glue. He has to choose between monkey barring
or walking across the glue. And I would very much advise
he does not walk across the glue. So far so good on the monkey bars. Keep going, buddy. Come on. - Come on, Darcy do it!
- Let's do it. Two minutes has gone by. Go on your head, man. Oh, no. Why are you spinning? 
Stop spinning. If he falls, that is not good, because that is the stickiest
glue in the world. I'm not even joking,
he'll lose his shoes. Oh, yeah. It's already been 2 minutes. Dude, he's swinging. 
He didn't touch the ground once. The man is glueless.
He made it to the exit. Oh, yeah. He's about to lift up that lid. And now he's about to enter
the craziest room. Keep taking us down. Watch this. You're going to see him
jump down. Oh my God, boys, I'm so tired. Oh, Darcy's struggling, but he's making his way down 
the rope onto floor three, the boulder room. This one should be pretty simple. All right, Darcy,
See that giant boulder? Yes. Well, these two ropes are the only thing
preventing it from barreling down the ramp. There's also a machete. and let's just say 
you'll need it to get out of this room. You're losing time. what do you think you'd do with the knife? - I'm trying to cut these ropes.
- Cut that rope. You're running out of time. Normally in our videos, when someone 
does something this slow, we cut it out, but this is life. We literally can't cut it out.
I am freaking out. Seven minutes remain. He's almost through the first of two
ropes. This is like some James Bond stuff 
right here. As he goes lower, the floors are
going to get harder and take longer. He's actually not making as good
pace as you would want him to make. That rope is going to take him
the longest because of how thick it is. Cut the rope. - He's wasting a lot of time on this.
- He's behind right now. This knife is so dull. You're going to have to hurry. Under seven minutes remain 
before your $250,000 explodes. Bro is still cutting the rope. Jimmy, what's going
to happen here? When he cuts that second rope? Something crazy is going to happen. And Darcy, what do you think 
is going to happen when you cut that rope? All right, I guess Darcy's locked in. Jimmy, what is going to happen
when he cuts the rope? This boulder is going to go, 
I guess, through the window. - Tell me, please,
- All you need to do... - Yes.
- Is hold onto that when he cuts the rope. Okay, That's. That's. I can handle that. There's no way I'm losing this 250
grand because of this stupid rope. Jimmy, why did you find the slowest
man possible at cutting a rope? Darcy, hurry up. Like I told
you at the start, this is real time. You're seeing everything. Obviously,
Darcy's pretty occupied right now, but if you could talk to us,
he'd probably tell us about the fact that he's a world
class escape artist, but apparently is not the best
at cutting ropes. Darcy, you spent a whole minute on this. Oh, my God. Cut faster, come on. Bro, you have got to cut 
the rope a lot faster. Oh my gosh. Oh, he's about to finish the last
rope. Darcy, push the boulder down the ramp. So, the boulders is going to... - You'll see in a bit.
- Okay. He's pushing the boulder now. - Brace yourself.
- What the... Back up. - Keep going.
- What? Darcy, quick, 
grab that rope from the ceiling and attach it to the latch
on the front of your pants. Make 100% sure that it's connected. What is he going to do? All right, now, jump down. Step out to the edge
and turn around. - All right.
- Watch this. Watch what? Am I going to have to jump, Jimmy? Oh my God, he's about to jump. Go to your right.
Go to your right. What is he going to do? - What is he doing?
- He is about to jump. All right, Darcy,
you're going to have to jump down. Oh my God, how am I going to do this? - Let's go, Darcy.
- Darcy, jump. What the... Okay. He has exactly 5 minutes left. Stop the crane. Stop the crane, stop the crane, stop the crane. All right, I don't know, 
the crane operator is drunk. You got to make it through
the lasers. This floor is by far
the hardest yet. Not only does
he get to make it through this laser maze, if he accidentally touches a laser, his money will instantly explode. How am I going to do this?
There's so many lasers. While he's doing this laser room. I'm going to tell you guys about
T-Mobile, my new wireless partner. In here? - Mack.
- What? You probably know T-Mobile
from this coverage map. - Yes, I do. I do.
- But here's the thing. Okay. You know,
great coverage is to be expected. Okay. But what T-Mobile has 
that other carriers don't... Jimmy, he's halfway
through the lasers now. Oh, he's on our side.
But what makes T-Mobile special is they have something 
called Magenta Status. Okay. What is Magenta Status? It's where they treat
you like a VIP. Just by using T-Mobile, 
you can get a reduced cost at hotel rooms, you can get free in-flight Wi-Fi, 
access to VIP lounge. - Go, go, go.
- All right. T-Mobile, I'm stressing out. Sorry if I'm forgetting 
lines and a bunch of other stuff. - And the best part is, Mack...
- It's right there, Jimmy, yes. - Yes, let me finish the T-Mobile ad.
- Okay. And the best part is... 
He's jumping in the water. It's all available. Day one,
when you switch to T-Mobile. So, if you're not currently using T-Mobile,
start using now. You can get all these perks 
literally today. Let me just catch my breath here. See how at tmobile.com/status. Oh, he's in the water. Oh my God. All right, this is it, 
the last level. He now has to open the four valves
in each quarter of the room, allowing all the water to drain, Then he can escape out
the front door and hit the button
to save his money from blowing up. You got to turn these. Turn these things? - Turn.
- Turn the knob. What's he doing? Actually, don't help him. Let's see if he's smart enough 
to win the money. Will he be able to hold his breath
long enough to unscrew all four valves,
or will he run out of time? Did the water come out? Hey, he did it. While this guy is doing 
this intense challenge, I want tell you about the greatest
tasting chocolate on the planet. Feastables. Mack. What do you think of Feastables? Oh, it's my favorite. Oh no, he's going for the one 
he just finished. Hey, hey.
No, no. Do the other one, do the other one. - You got to keep going.
- There's four. How much time is left? Oh, three minutes. Yeah. He actually kind of
just wasted, like, 30 seconds. He could do this if you just hurries up. Come on, catch your breath, let's go. Mack, he's about to go under, 
go around this side, see if it opens. He didn't do it yet. He didn't do it yet. All right, keep turning. - Oh, he did it.
- Other side, other side. - Oh my God.
- Two down, two to go, baby. All right. He's now making
his way to the other side. - You got to go swim down.
- Oh my God This is coming down to the wire. I cannot imagine how absolutely
exhausted he is right now. Ok. All right, so he has two minutes 
and 10 seconds to, right over here, press that red button 
or his money will explode. It's coming down to the wire. You got it. You got it. I don't know what to do. Normally, we do cuts and edits,
but this is like real time. Everything I'm saying is making it. - Oh, he's got less than two minutes. Bro.
- Thereâ€™s just two minutes. - Hey, less than two minutes.
- Go faster. He's getting close, he's getting close. He got it. He just did it, he got all four. He did it. All right, the final door,
a minute, 50 seconds. All right, what now? Now he has to open this door, run
and press the button. - How much time does he have?
- Just under 2 minutes. How is he going to pull this off? I don't get it. You're going to get wet if you stand there,
you might want to back up. Why? Open it. There is so much more water 
that still needs to drain. - All right, Mack, hey.
- Go faster. Mack, in case he fails, 
that bomb will blow up, so I need you to just, hide behind 
the sandbags over there if he messes up, - Okay?
- Okay. Just trust me. What do I do? You have to unscrew all the latches. Get him out of there, come on. Almost a minute, come on, come on. Bro... I don't know if he's
going to make it at this point. The door stuck because there's
too much water pressure. He needs to wait for it to drain
more. Wait, Jimmy, the water is starting
 to come out the front door. Turn it, turn it, turn it and pull it. Pull it. You got to go, buddy. 
You've got to go. He's stuck in that one, 
he can't get it. Something's wrong. Bro, this is it. 
He's going to fail. He can't figure out
how to open the door. He literally has 45 seconds 
to hit this button. It stuck, come on. Bro, he can't get these latches off 
to save his life. Bro... What is he doing? Come on. Come on. You got 30 seconds, 
come on, come on. Go! You have to slide through the door 
and hit the button. Go faster. Go. Go! - Come on.
- Come on. Hurry, before the bomb blows up. - Yeah!
- Yeah! And after he won with 19 seconds left, we cleared 
the money out of the way the bomb, and asked him
what he was going to spend it on. I'm having a baby tomorrow. What? And then we blew the building up. Oh Gosh. I hope you enjoy the explosion. We have to make this video 
exactly 10 minutes. Goodbye.","This video is completely real time. You'll notice it's exactly 10 minutes long. There are no cuts. And if Darcy does not escape his jacket and get through all five floors of this tower and press that button before the timer hits Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â zero, his money explodes."
Top 5 BEST Smartphones of 2024,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoMDV0TsQc,752.0,en,"what's up guys saf you're on super saf TV and we are almost at the end of 2024 and that means it's time for my top five smartphone picks of the year now as always there are a few disclaimers before we start I have used lots of different smartphones this year as you can see but I've not used every single one so no doubt my list will be different to your list and that's absolutely fine guys we can still be friends drop your favorites down in the comments below and this list is in no particular order I'm just giving you my top five but I will be revealing my favorites my daily drivers in the upcoming super sa style collaboration with all my friends that we do every year so if you want to see that first then do subscribe and hit that Bell icon so you don't miss it now with all of that out the way let's get to the list so the first Mone in my list once again in no particular order is well let's do an iPhone because there was no iPhone featured in my media list because there was no new iPhone out at that time my iPhone of choice in 2024 it's an obvious one it's the iPhone 16 Pro Max I use my iPhone 16 Pro Max every single day I like the larger display I love the consistent cameras and I still think as an overall camera package it is my go-to we've still got some of the best video quality on any smartphone with 4K 120 frames a second which other smartphones do offer but the amount of control that you have on that slow motion is the best on the iPhone in my opinion we've got amazing battery life and exceptional performance with the a18 pro which handles anything that you throw at it and it's also great for console level gaming now of course the main headline feature for the new iPhones was Apple intelligence but the new iPhones didn't launch with apple intelligence and it has been a roll out and we still won't get all of the features until sometime next year but so far from what I've been using although I don't use all of them the ones that have really stood out to me notification summaries somebody that's on so many different group chats it's nice just to have a quick summary and really see if it requ has my attention or not and the other Apple intelligence feature that I have been using is recording audio and then generating transcripts and summaries and this is so useful for meetings and we have to talk about the camera control button I'm going to be completely honest with you I pretty much never use it and that's something that I found with my p as well everybody that I've asked has said I don't use it at all now I think Apple try to go for the best of both WS for portrait and landscape shooting but in doing so they've made it impractical for both uses when you're using it portrait it's too low when you're using in landscape it's too in and like many others that I've spoken to they've just stopped using it all together but despite that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is an amazing smartphone and it's definitely one of the best of 2024 an honorable mention has to go to the iPhone 16 Pro if you're somebody who doesn't want a huge smartphone and doesn't want to really have any compromises then the iPhone 16 Pro offers pretty much everything that the iPhone 16 Pro Max does apart from that larger display and the battery life but you still do get things like that 5x zoom camera now let's move on to the next smartphone in my list now this Smartphone was actually one of the first smartphones to release this year and it still holds up it made my top five list in the midia video to and is of course the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra now this is just an amazing allrounder it taks all of the boxes I really do like the new flat display with gorilla glass armor which reduces Reflections and really makes a big difference when you're viewing the screen day to-day the new five time zoom camera performs really well for portraits and it's also great for extended Zoom we've got the Snapdragon H gen 3 for Galaxy across the board meaning we've got amazing performance and then we have the S Pen which is something that I don't use every day but when I do use it I'm so glad it's there Samsung has promised seven generations of Android OS updates which is amazing and they've actually lived up I've had lots of updates on my s24 ultra including new AI features now I'm going to be honest with you I don't use all of them especially some of the live translate features I think they are very very specific but there are some AI features which I've gotten so used to that I can't live without summarizing web pages is something that I use pretty much every single day instead of having to read a long article just getting a quick summary is so useful and I absolutely love sketch to image now this is a bit of a fun feature it's something that you might not be using every day but it works so well and I've had so much fun making memes and things with friends and people are just like blown away when they see how good good the results can be battery life is also good although I would say it's not as good as some other smartphones out there and I do have to give some honorable mentions to the s24 and the s24 plus which give you a lot of what the s24 ultra offers but at a lower price now although Samsung did absolutely amazing with the s24 series one area where I think they were kind of lazy and didn't do so well is with their full series the Samsung Galaxy Zed full 6 does not make my top five list because it was a very incremental update and instead we've got much better foldables in my opinion at least when it comes to the hardware and the one that's right on top for me is the honor magic V3 and that is the best widely available foldable in my opinion it's an impossible 4.35 mm when it's unfolded just 9.2 mm when it's folded and it weighs 226 G which means that on your day today with it 6.43 in cover screen you can use it as a regular smartphone but then when you do want to do some gaming multitasking or something that requires the larger screen then you can reveal that beautiful 7.92 in 120 HZ display the hardware on the honor magic V3 is honestly mind-blowing and we have a huge 5,150 mAh battery which they've managed to fit in to this compact form factor with 66 WS of supercharging and 50 WS of Wireless charging no compromises it has an ipx8 rating and we've got Flagship level cameras 50 megapixel primary a 40 megap Ultra wide as well as an ultra slim 50 megap Periscope telephoto camera with 3.5 times Optical Zoo performance is great with a Snapdragon 8 gen 3 and although we don't have as many years of software updates promise compared to the likes of Google and Samsung we still have a respectable 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security patches we have some useful AI features such as face to- face translation but we don't have many generative AI features like we have on the competition but nevertheless this is easily one of my favorite foldables of all time now I have to give some honorable mentions to other foldables that we saw this year Samsung although they didn't do a great job with the fold 6 we do have the fold 6 special edition which is what the fold 6 should have been that wasn't widely available and if it was then that might have made my list Vivo did an amazing job with the Vivo XF 3 Pro and Huawei with the mate XD the world's first trip affordable I was absolutely blown away by this and I really really wish H we was still fully in the Western Market so I could purchase it easily unfortunately it's like $5,000 and I don't have $5,000 to spare Google also did a great job with the pixel9 pro fold which is a huge step up in Hardware compared to the previous generation but the pixel that made my list is the Google pixel 9 Pro XL now I've always loved the visor design that Google have had for a few years I think the pixel9 pro and pro XL have a great Evolution to this unique Visa design it's probably one of the only smartphones out there that's not going to rock on the table you've got a beautiful 6.8in ltpo display we finally got an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner which works really well and we've got great cameras with that pixel look which I really like especially for video with video boost in my super style camera comparison of the gole pixel9 Pro XL versus the iPhone 16 Pro Max in many instances I actually found the pixel to have better video quality with video boost being a Google device Google have promised 7 years of os and security updates and we've got some really cool AI features some of them might be gimmicky but the one that I found myself using quite a bit was adme and it's such a useful feature so much so that there's been many instances where I've not had the Google pixel with me and I've wished that the device I was using had add me so I could use it now as much as I love the photos and videos that come out of the Google pixel9 pro one area that they definitely have to improve is with portrait mode portrait mode was really hit a Miss on the pixel 9 Pro XL in my experience hopefully this can be improve your software updates and although video is amazing it does need to be uploaded to the cloud processed and it has to come back a few hours later and if you're somebody that's not very patient and wants to post stuff straight away then this is definitely going to be a disadvantage on the pixel and although the performance is absolutely fine for your day today with the tens G4 it just doesn't live up to the performance to the likes of the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 for the Apple a18 Pro now if you are somebody that's after performance you love gaming then the final smartphone on my list once again in no particular order is going to be the smartphone for you and that is the Rog phone 9 pro and pro 9 Edition now you might be thinking hold on saf is this not a 2025 smartphone well Asus went ahead and released it super early in November and it's still 2024 so I'm going to count it as a 2024 smartphone now the RG phone 9 Pro is absolute Beast you've got the Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile platform you've got up to 24 GB of RAM with 1 tab of storage and if you're somebody who likes to game for long periods of time then with the aeroactive cooler it's going to keep things super cool for sustained performance now although this device is is built for gaming it still is an excellent smartphone regardless you've got a beautiful 6.78 in 185 HZ display it's got ip68 water and dust resistance it's got some of the loudest and best speakers you're going to find on any smartphone and you've got a huge 5,800 mAh battery which will keep you going all day long but most importantly it has an anime Vision mini LED display at the back with 648 dots which means you can have custom animations you can have useful information such as your battery life the time but now you can also play retro games on the back of your phone is this a gimmick 100% but it's a very fun gimmick now realistically speaking how much are you going to be playing games on the back of your smartphone when you've got an absolute beast on the front of your smartphone I don't know but I just think it's such a cool thing that makes it stand out now one area that Asus definitely need to improve on is when it comes to software updates they are only promising two major OS updates and 5 years of security updates which when you look at the likes of Samsung and Google is just not enough but that aside if you're after the best gaming smartphone that you can buy right now my pick would be the Rog phone 9 Pro and that brings us to the end of the list but there are some honorable mentions the first honorable mention is the honor magic 6 Pro do you see what I did there this was featured in my medor list as well as the OnePlus 12 the nothing phone 2A as well as the PO F6 all great devices which still hold up but of course we do get recency buyers you can check out my video of the midia list if you want to see more details about those smartphones and although I wasn't hugely impressed with the Samsung Galaxy Zed F 6 I was very much impressed with the Zed flip 6 which in my opinion is the best flip smartphone you can buy right now the Oppo findex 8 Pro with the ds9400 also gets an honorable mention I've just not had enough time to test it out and some of the new Vivo devices as well unfortunately I've just not had them in hand as yet they are on the way so we'll cover those in future videos and that is my top five smartphone list of 2024 with the honorable mentions what are your top five drop them in the comments below remember our list will be different we can still be friends and as we've had every year we will have the super sa style collaboration with all of my friends so be sure to subscribe and hit that Bell icon so you don't miss it I hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful if you did then do smash that like button for me thanks for watching this is on super TV and I'll see you next time",Saf's top five smartphone picks of the year. No iPhone featured in media list because there was no new iPhon. Top five in no particular order.
100+ JavaScript Concepts you Need to Know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIFF4maKMU,744.0,en,JavaScript It's a Wonderful programming language to learn for beginners it's also a horrible programming language to learn for beginners on one hand you can build almost anything with it and get a job anywhere if you master it on the other hand it's weird ugly and surrounded by a dystopian Wasteland of Frameworks and libraries don't want to sound like a dick or nothing but uh it says on your chart that you're [Â __Â ] up welcome to JavaScript 101 over the next few minutes you'll learn 101 different things you need to know about JavaScript like how to use it where to use it and why it is the way it is by the end of this video you'll be able to build a website a mobile app a desktop app a server an operating system artificial intelligence and all kinds of other stuff you shouldn't build with it it was created in 1993 by Brendan Ike at Netscape at the time the web browser was cutting edge technology that connected everybody on the planet via the worldwide web now that I've gotten on the internet I'd rather be on my computer than doing just about anything at the time websites were completely static with pure HTML JavaScript was designed as an easyto use highle language to help developers make these websites interactive today it's arguably the most popular language in the world and its standard implementation is called ecmascript and is the default language in all web browsers in fact it's the only code that natively runs in a browser aside from web assembly however the browser is not the only runtime and you can also run JavaScript code on a server thanks to tools like node.js and Dino as the name implies JavaScript is a scripting language that means you can execute code on the Fly by opening up the console in your browser Dev tools to run some code that changes the appearance of a website at any time it's interpreted line by line as opposed to other languages like C that are compiled ahead of time however interpreted is not the most accurate term to use here under the hood of the browser there's an engine called V8 it makes JavaScript run extremely fast by taking your code and converting it to machine code with a process called Just in Time compilation but none of this stuff really matters let's jump into some code to use JavaScript on a web page you'll first need an HTML document inside of which we'll have script tag you can write code inside the tag directly or reference an external file with the source attribute now to say hello world use console log which is javascript's built-in tool for printing to the standard output now open the HTML file in a browser and you should see the value printed out in the dev tools there are several different ways to Define variables the most common of which today is let start by giving it a name which will normally be in camel case then assign a value to it it's a dynamically typed language which means no data type annotations are necessary in this case I've assigned a number which is one of the seven primitive data types built into the language however we don't need to assign the variable a value right now because it can be reassigned later without an assignment it automatically uses the Primitive value of undefined as its default value however we can explicitly represent an empty value using null and later on we could reassign that same variable to a string it's an entirely different data type but that's perfectly okay now any value that's not a primitive will inherit from the object class but more on that later right now now we need to talk about this semicolon technically semicolons are optional because if you leave them out the JavaScript parser will add them automatically in real life JavaScript developers will often fight to the death over whether or not to use semicolons but let is not the only way to define a variable another common option is const which is used for variables that cannot be reassigned later but the original way to declare a variable is VAR I would recommend ignoring its existence altogether although you will find it out in the wild the reason we have so many different ways to Define variables has to do with the lexical environment which determines where variables work and where they don't there's Global scope which is where we are right now which means this variable will be available everywhere however if we Define a variable inside a function it then becomes local to that function and cannot be used outside of it and finally if you have a statement like an if condition variables can be scoped inside the braces or block unless you use VAR for that variable which is not block scope in which case it will be hoisted up into the local scope for that function and trust me you don't want that weirdness in your life when the function keyword is used by itself it's called a function definition or statement functions are one of the main building blocks in JavaScript and they work by taking an input or argument then optionally return a value that can be used somewhere else now functions are just objects which means they can also be used as Expressions allowing them to be used as variables or to construct higher order functions where a function is used as an argument or a return value functions can also be nested to create a closure that encapsulates data and logic from the rest of the program normally when you call a function that has a variable with a primitive value it's stored on the call stack which is the browser's short-term memory however when you create a closure the inner function can still access variables in the outer function even after the initial function call that happens because JavaScript automatically stores the data in the outer function in the Heap memory which will persist between function calls you'll rarely have to think about that as a developer but what you're more likely to run into is this it's a keyword that references an object based on how a function is called when called from the global scope it references the window object in the browser however if that same function is attached to an object and called by that object this will be a reference to that object and you can manually bind a function to some other object using the bind method this can be rather confusing but modern JavaScript has another way to define functions using the arrow syntax Arrow functions don't have their own this value and they're always Anonymous which makes them ideal for function Expressions now one last thing you need to know about functions is that when passing arguments a primitive like a number is passed by value which means a copy is created of the original variable however if the argument is an object that means it's stored in the Heap and it's passed by reference that means multiple parts of the code might be mutating the same object speaking of which let's talk about objects the easiest way to define one is with the object literal syntax using braces but there's also an object type that can be created with a Constructor using the new keyword an object contains a collection of key value pairs or properties and values what's interesting interesting is that objects can inherit properties from each other thanks to a mechanism called the Prototype chain every object has a private property that links to exactly one prototype this differs from class-based inheritance found in many other languages because we're dealing with real objects that take up memory as opposed to abstract classes in your code now what's confusing is Javascript supports object-oriented programming with a class keyword however classes are just syntactic sugar for prototypal inheritance and objects a class can define a Constructor which is a function that's called when the object is first created it can also have properties and optionally create Getters and Setters to access them and it more easily encapsulates functions by organizing them as methods on an object instance or making them Global to the class name with the static keyword in addition to objects JavaScript has a bunch of built-in data structures like an array for holding a dynamic collection of indexed items or a set to hold a collection of unique items or map which also holds a key value pair like an object but can be more easily looped over along with a variety of other features now what you should also know at this point is that JavaScript is garbage collected that means it will automatically deallocate objects from memory when they're no longer referenced in your code however when you have a map all the properties will always be referenced if that's not optimal there's a weak map and weak set that contain properties that can be garbage collected to reduce memory usage now that we have a basic idea of what JavaScript looks like let's talk about one of its most interesting features which is its non-blocking event Loop normally when you write code in a script it's executed synchronously line by line which means the next line can't start until the previous line finishes with an event Loop we can write a synchronous code in JavaScript that runs in a separate threadpool while the rest of the application continues to execute this is really important because modern websites often have multiple things going on at the same time but they only have access to a single thread for computing called the main thread without asynchronous code it would be impossible to multitask an easy way to demonstrate this is with set timeout which takes a function as an argument but won't call that function until X number of milliseconds have elapsed this is called a call back function because it gets in cued in the event Loop only to be called back later when it's ready to execute on the main thread callback functions are very common but when they're overused and become too deeply nested it leads to a situation called call back hell luckily there are better ways to write a sync code like a promise A promise is a wrapper for a value that's unknown right now but that will resolve to a value in the future like maybe a call to a third party API that resolves to some data if something goes wrong the promise can reject to raise an error now the consumer of the promise can use methods like then and catch to handle these two possible outcomes or better yet you can define an async function that will automatically return a promise then in the body of the function we can pause its execution using the await keyword to wait for other promises to resolve this results in nice readable code however in order to implement error handling you want to wrap this code in a TR catch block now as your code grows in complexity it won't all fit in a single file luckily we can use modules to share code between files by default all the code in a file or module is private to that file however if there's some code we want to use elsewhere like a function we can make it a default export this allows us to go into a different file and use an import statement to use the function there as well it's also possible to export multiple values from a single file and then import them by name in the other file but often what you'll do in JavaScript land is use code written by an entirely different developer the largest JavaScript package manager is npm when you install a package from npm it downloads its code into the node modules folder in your project it also provides a package Json file that will list out all the dependencies used in your project now let's go into the code and assume we're building a website on the web the code will run in the browser which is based on the document object model where the UI is represented as a tree of HTML elements or nodes the browser provides apis to interact with these nodes with the most important object being the document the document allows us to grab an individ ual HTML element using a method called query selector it takes a CSS selector as an argument and we'll find the HTML element that has the same class Name ID or tag name it returns an instance of the element class which itself has a variety of properties and methods to get information about it or change its behavior in addition we can grab multiple elements at the same time using query selector all most importantly we can listen to events that happen to it like when a button is clicked with add event listener we can assign a function that will be called whenever that event takes place much of web development revolves around listening to events and updating the UI accordingly however one thing that many developers dislike about vanilla JavaScript is that it results in imperative code where the UI is mutated directly many developers now use front-end Frameworks that produce declarative code where the UI is a function of its input data these libraries encapsulate JavaScript HTML and CSS into components which are then used together to form a component tree to represent the UI most importantly inside a component data is reactive it can be from the JavaScript directly to the HTML that means anytime data changes the UI will be updated automatically now after you build a complete Javascript app you'll need to take all of your JavaScript files and combine them into a single bundle that can be used by the browser to handle this process efficiently you'll need a tool called a module bundler like V or webpack one problem though is that sometimes this Javascript file can get too big which affects the page load performance and this can be measured by the network waterfall in your browser Dev tools luckily it's possible to split this JavaScript bundle into multiple files then use Dynamic Imports in your code to only import that JavaScript when it becomes needed now JavaScript doesn't just run in the browser but also on the server node.js is the most popular runtime and you can execute JavaScript code at any time using the node command this opens the door to Frameworks like electron which combine node.js with a browser to create full stack desktop apps with JavaScript or IOS and Android apps with react native at this point you've got 99 problems and JavaScript is every single one of them if you want to make life easier here use a tool like typescript or ES lent that does static analysis to improve your code quality congratulations for reaching the end of JavaScript 101 if you want to go beyond this video I just released a brand new JavaScript course on fireship IO this video is the introduction to that course which is followed by a deeper dive into these Concepts then we work on some Hands-On projects with a bunch of quizzes along the way thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one, JavaScript is a wonderful programming language to learn for beginners. It was created in 1993 by Brendan Ike at Netscape. By the end of this video you'll be able to build a website a mobile app a desktop app a server an operating system.
